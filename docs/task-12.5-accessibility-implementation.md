- **LiveRegion Component**: Dynamic announcements for state changes
- **SkipToContent Component**: Skip navigation for keyboard users
- **useFocusTrap Hook**: Trap focus within modals and dialogs
- **useAnnouncement Hook**: Programmatic screen reader announcements
- **useHighContrastMode Hook**: Detect and respond to high contrast preferences
- **useReducedMotion Hook**: Detect and respect reduced motion preferences
- **useKeyboardNavigation Hook**: Enhanced keyboard navigation support
- **ARIA Utilities**: Helper functions for ARIA attributes and relationships

### 2. Enhanced Layout Structure

- **Skip Navigation**: Added skip links in root layout for keyboard users
- **Landmark Regions**: Proper header, main, and navigation roles in ClientLayout
- **Focus Management**: Enhanced focus indicators with brand colors and proper contrast

## Component Enhancements

### 3. CheckInButton Component Accessibility

- **Screen Reader Announcements**:
  - Location acquisition progress
  - Validation success/failure
  - Check-in/check-out process status
  - Error states with detailed feedback
- **ARIA Attributes**:
  - Comprehensive aria-label describing button state and action
  - aria-describedby for error states
  - Dynamic button descriptions based on current state
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard operability
- **AnnouncementRegion**: Live region for dynamic status updates

### 4. SchoolList Component Accessibility

- **Search Enhancement**:
  - Proper label association with hidden label
  - Screen reader announcements for search results
  - ARIA-describedby for search result count
  - Live region updates for filtered results
- **School Cards**:
  - Proper role attributes (button/article based on interactivity)
  - Keyboard navigation support with Enter/Space key handling
  - Comprehensive aria-label for selectable schools
  - Enhanced location button with descriptive aria-label
- **Icon Accessibility**: All decorative icons marked with aria-hidden="true"

### 5. AdminDashboard Component Accessibility

- **Data Loading Announcements**: Screen reader feedback for successful/failed data loads
- **Dashboard Statistics**: Enhanced with announcement system for status updates

### 6. LoginForm Component Accessibility

- **Form Structure**:
  - Hidden form title for screen readers
  - Proper form attributes (noValidate, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby)
  - Field-specific error associations with aria-describedby
  - Enhanced error alert with role="alert" and proper ID
- **Authentication Feedback**:
  - Success/failure announcements for email sign-in
  - Success/failure announcements for Google OAuth
  - Detailed error messaging with assertive announcements
- **Button Enhancement**:
  - Enhanced aria-label for Google sign-in button
  - Form error state association

### 7. UI Component Enhancements

- **Button Component**: Enhanced focus ring with brand colors and proper contrast ratios
- **Error States**: All error alerts include role="alert" for immediate screen reader attention

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Features

### Keyboard Navigation

- **Tab Order**: Logical tab sequence throughout application
- **Focus Indicators**: High-contrast focus rings meeting WCAG contrast requirements
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter and Space key support for interactive elements
- **Skip Links**: Skip to main content functionality

### Screen Reader Support

- **Semantic Markup**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark regions
- **ARIA Labels**: Descriptive labels for all interactive elements
- **Live Regions**: Dynamic content announcements
- **State Communication**: Current state of buttons and form fields clearly communicated

### Visual Accessibility

- **Focus Management**: Enhanced focus indicators with 2px offset and brand colors
- **High Contrast Support**: Detection and response to system high contrast settings
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect for user motion preferences

### Form Accessibility

- **Label Association**: All form fields properly labeled
- **Error Identification**: Clear error states with ARIA error associations
- **Required Fields**: Proper indication of required vs optional fields
- **Validation Feedback**: Immediate feedback for form validation states

## Technical Implementation Details

### Announcement System

```typescript
const { announce } = useAnnouncement();
announce("Success message", "polite"); // Non-intrusive
announce("Error message", "assertive"); // Immediate attention
```

### ARIA Utilities Usage

```typescript
const formProps = ARIA.getFormControlProps(id, {
  label: "Field Label",
  description: "Help text",
  error: "Error message",
  required: true,
  invalid: hasError,
});
```

### Focus Management

```typescript
const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
useFocusTrap(containerRef); // Automatic focus trapping
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Screen Reader Testing

- Test with VoiceOver (macOS), NVDA (Windows), and JAWS
- Verify all interactive elements are announced correctly
- Check navigation landmarks and heading structure
- Test dynamic content announcements

### Keyboard Testing

- Tab through entire application without mouse
- Verify all interactive elements are reachable
- Test skip links functionality
- Ensure focus is always visible

### Automated Testing

- Run axe-core accessibility testing
- Validate HTML semantics
- Check color contrast ratios
- Test with various zoom levels

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Components to Enhance

- **AssignmentModal**: Add focus trap and announcement system
- **Navigation Components**: Enhance mobile menu accessibility
- **Data Tables**: Add sortable table headers and row selection
- **File Upload Components**: Enhanced progress announcements

### Advanced Features

- **Voice Control**: Enhanced voice navigation support
- **Gesture Support**: Touch gesture alternatives for motor impaired users
- **Cognitive Accessibility**: Simplified navigation modes
- **Internationalization**: Right-to-left language support
